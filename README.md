# Eigenfaces

Eigenfaces is an excercise from the book: “Coding the Matrix (Linear Algebra through Applica- tions to Computer Science)” By Philip N. Klein - Brown University

Ideally the project should be seen on the .ipynb format, which is the jupyter notebook. If
jupyter notebbok is not available you can see the pdf.

 * Eigenfaces Code.pdf -> pdf file with the jupyter notebook script in pdf format.

 * Eigenfaces.ipynb -> Jupyter notebook of the eigenfaces project.

 * Eigenfaces.py -> python script version of the eigenfaces project.

 * eigenFacesFunction.py -> Helper Functions needed for the eigenfaces project to run.

 * orthogonalit.py -> A python script that contains functions regarding orthogonality of vectors
and matrices.
